# Multiple Tor Instances for Hidden Services/Tunnels

![Screenshot](more_onions.jpg)
###### Image K.I generated

Run multiple Tor instances with different configuration files (torrc) to host different hidden services/tunnels on the same machine. This setup is particularly useful when working with tools like SoCat for offensive security purposes.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the Tor service installed on your system.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Tor Service

Ensure Tor is installed on your system:
```
sudo apt-get install tor
```

### 2. Create Configuration Directories

Create a new directory for each hidden service configuration:
```
sudo mkdir -p /etc/tor/instances/hidden_service_1
sudo mkdir -p /etc/tor/instances/hidden_service_2
```
Replace `hidden_service_1` and `hidden_service_2` with the desired names for your hidden services.

### 3. Create Configuration Files

Create new configuration files for each hidden service:
```
sudo nano /etc/tor/instances/hidden_service_1/torrc
sudo nano /etc/tor/instances/hidden_service_2/torrc
```
Add the following configuration to each torrc file, adjusting the `HiddenServiceDir` and `HiddenServicePort` values as needed:
```
RunAsDaemon 1
DataDirectory /var/lib/tor/instances/hidden_service_1
PidFile /var/run/tor/instances/hidden_service_1.pid
SocksPort 0 
ExitRelay 0  
HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service_1/
HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:9000
```

```
RunAsDaemon 1
DataDirectory /var/lib/tor/instances/hidden_service_2
PidFile /var/run/tor/instances/hidden_service_2.pid
SocksPort 0 
ExitRelay 0  
HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service_2/
HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:9001
```
Replace `hidden_service_1` with the appropriate hidden service name, and adjust the `HiddenServicePort` value to point to the correct local address and port for the associated web service (e.g., Nginx reverse proxy listening on a different port for each hidden service).

Save the changes and exit the editor.

### 4. Set Up Directories and Permissions

Create the required directories and set the correct ownership for the data directories:
```
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/tor/instances/hidden_service_1
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/tor/instances/hidden_service_2
sudo chown -R debian-tor:debian-tor /var/lib/tor/instances
```

### 5. Create Systemd Service Files

Create a new systemd service file for each Tor instance:
```
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/tor@hidden_service_1.service
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/tor@hidden_service_2.service
```
Add the following content to each systemd service file, adjusting the `hidden_service_1` and `hidden_service_2` values as needed:
```
[Unit]
Description=Tor Hidden Service %I
After=network.target

[Service]
User=debian-tor
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/tor -f /etc/tor/instances/%I/torrc
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Save the changes and exit the editor.

### 6. Reload Systemd and Start Services

Reload the systemd configuration:
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```
Enable and start the new Tor instances:
```
sudo systemctl enable tor@hidden_service_1.service
sudo systemctl start tor@hidden_service_1.service
sudo systemctl enable tor@hidden_service_2.service
sudo systemctl start tor@hidden_service_2.service
```

### 7. Check Service Status

Check the status of the new Tor instances to ensure they are running correctly:
```
sudo systemctl status tor@hidden_service_1.service
sudo systemctl status tor@hidden_service_2.service
```

### 8. Retrieve .onion Addresses

Retrieve the .onion addresses for your hidden services:
```
sudo cat /var/lib/tor/hidden_service_1/hostname
sudo cat /var/lib/tor/hidden_service_2/hostname
```

Note the .onion addresses for each hidden service, as you will use them to access the respective services.

Now you have multiple Tor instances running with different torrc files, each hosting a separate hidden service/tunnel.
